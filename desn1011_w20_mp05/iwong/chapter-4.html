                        <p class="paragraph-8">It is not like I am unhappy for Tai’s popularity but she also starts flaunting her newfound status, which is not cool at all. I saw Travis trying to open up a friendly interaction with her and she calls him a “slacker”?! Tai has become soooo arrogant over her popularity. She used to be such a sweetheart!</p>
                        <h4 class="text-end-4">“You’re a virgin who can’t drive,” </h4>
                        <p class="paragraph-9">This was what Tai called me when I ‘questioned’ Tai’s attraction to Josh, and I realized that I have “created some sort of a monster.”</p>
