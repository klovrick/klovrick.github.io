                                <p>They go to the harbor where the deal happens. The group starts to kill everyone on
                                    the boat. Hockney discovers a van full of money but is shot by Soze. McManus and
                                    Keaton are left, and discover that there were no drugs on the boat. They are both
                                    killed by Soze. Verbal explains that he was too scared to shoot Soze, as he saw him
                                    kill Keaton and blew up the boat.
                                    Kujan has a theory that Soze actually hired the crew to wipe out a witness so that
                                    Soze’s identity would stay anonymous. Since the lawyer of the witness was Keaton’s
                                    girlfriend, Keaton must be Keyser Soze. Verbal was left as a cover story and
                                    Keaton’s girlfriend was recently found dead, meaning he had tied up all loose ends.
                                    Verbal defeated and crying, accepts this truth that Kujan came to. </p>
